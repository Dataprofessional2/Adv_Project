## Project Overview: AirBnb Price Optimization

### Introduction
In this project, we explore how Airbnb hosts in Seattle can optimize pricing strategies to improve revenue and occupancy. Using the open Airbnb Seattle dataset, we analyze patterns in pricing across different property types, locations, and seasons. The goal is to build a predictive model that recommends optimal prices by leveraging available listing attributes and booking trends.


### Overview of [AirBnb Seattle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)
The dataset includes comprehensive information on Airbnb listings in Seattle, such as property features, pricing, availability, and customer reviews. Key files include:
- listings.csv: details on accommodations, amenities, host characteristics, and pricing
- calendar.csv: daily booking availability and prices
- reviews.csv: customer feedback and ratings
  
These datasets allow us to explore how various factors influence pricing decisions and how they can be optimized.


## Business Objective
The primary objective is to predict the ideal listing price for Airbnb properties in Seattle based on features such as location, room type, capacity, and host behavior. By identifying patterns and relationships within the data, we aim to help hosts set competitive yet profitable prices while ensuring higher occupancy rates.



## Data Cleaning & Preparation

#### Data Loading and Inspection
- The first step involves loading the datasets using Python libraries such as pandas and inspecting their structure. We check the shape, column types, and summary statistics to understand the data and identify areas that need cleaning.

#### Handling Missing Values
- Missing data is common in real-world datasets. We explore missing values across features like bathrooms, reviews, or price and decide on imputation techniques or row removal based on their impact on the model.

#### Data Cleaning and Formatting
- We format columns such as price by removing currency symbols, convert dates into datetime formats, and ensure consistency in categorical variables. This step prepares the data for efficient modeling.
